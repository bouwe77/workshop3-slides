# PROPS & STATE

- Props is data **between** components


- State is data **within** a component

---

# STATE

# FORMS

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Uncontrolled</b> inputs
    <ul>
      <li>The "Old Skool way"</li>
      <li>Easier</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <Appear>
    <li>
      <b>Controlled</b> inputs:
      <ul>
        <li>The "React way": events and state</li>
        <li>Better UX: interdependent fields, validation, local storage, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# EXERCISE 4

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# HURRAY!!!

<MyConfetti />

Our timeline functionality is DONE!

However, it’s all local state… :(

---

# APIS AND STATE

- You’ll need an HTTP library


- Keeping state in sync with api


- This is a side effect: useEffect hook

---

# EXAMPLE

- API calls


- Sync state


- useEffect hook (DANGER!)

---

# NITWIT API
