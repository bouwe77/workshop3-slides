I am **Bouwe**

Software Engineer @ New Nexus

<a href="https://bouwe.io">bouwe.io</a>

---

# AND YOU?

Name, employer, daily job, React?

---

# TO DO TODAY

---

# LET'S BUILD...

a <a href="https://nitwit.netlify.com" target="_blank">twitter clone</a> :)

---

# REACT?

---

# COMPONENTS

Small pieces of UI

---

# COMPONENTS

Example

---

# COMPONENTS

Reusability and Single Responsibility

---

# COMPONENTS

Parent-Child relationship

---

# COMPONENTS

A component is just 

a javascript function

---

# COMPONENTS

Such a function returns

a piece of UI: JSX

---

# EXAMPLE

Components

---

# SUMMARY OF THE EXAMPLES

- Component names start with **Capital Letter**

- Use **import/export** if your components are in separate files

- A component **always** returns JSX

- JSX can be both "html" and/or other ```<Components />```

- Javascript expressions in JSX between **curly brackets**

---

# EXERCISE 1

Create your first components

for the twitter clone

# EFFE WACHTE...

PIZZA!!!

# EXERCISE 1

Create your first components

for the twitter clone

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# PROPS

Passing data between components 

from **parent to child**

---

# EXAMPLE

Props

---

# EXERCISE 2

Pass props between components

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# STATE

Example code says more 

than a thousand words... ;)

---

# STATE & PROPS

- State is data **within** a component


- Props is data **between** components

---

# STATE

- One way data binding


- Events


- Re-render !== Repaint

---

# EXERCISE 3

Add state to a component:

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# FORMS

- Uncontrolled inputs: DOM


- Controlled inputs: state

---

# EXAMPLE

Forms

- Uncontrolled inputs


- Controlled inputs

---

# EXERCISE 4

Add a component with a form

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# HURRAY!!!

<MyConfetti />

Our timeline functionality is DONE!

However, it’s all local state… :(

---

# APIS AND STATE

- You’ll need an HTTP library


- Keeping state in sync with api


- This is a side effect: useEffect hook

---

# EXAMPLE

- API calls


- Sync state


- useEffect hook

---

**useEffect**

If you specify a list of dependencies 

as the last argument to useEffect (...)

it must include all values used inside (...).

That includes props, state, and anything 

derived from them.
