I am **Bouwe**

Software Engineer @ New Nexus

# AND YOU?

name, employer, daily job, react?

---

# PICS

...or it didn't happen?

---

# TO DO TODAY

---

# LET'S BUILD...

a <a href="https://nitwit.netlify.com" target="_blank">twitter clone</a> :)

---

# REACT?

---

# COMPONENTS

UI building blocks

---

# COMPONENTS

Example

---

# COMPONENTS

Reusability and Single Responsibility

---

# COMPONENTS

Parent-Child relationship

---

# COMPONENTS

A component is just 

a **javascript function**

---

# COMPONENTS

That function returns a piece of UI:

**JSX**

---

# CODE EXAMPLE

Components

---

# SUMMARY OF THE EXAMPLES

- Component names start with **Capital Letter**

- Use **import/export** if your components are in separate files

- A component **always** returns JSX

- JSX can be both "html" and/or other &lt;Components /&gt;

- Javascript expressions in JSX between **curly brackets**

---

# EXERCISE 1

Create your first components

for the twitter clone

<img src={require("file-loader!./images/pizza.jpg")}/>

# EFFE WACHTE...

PIZZA!!!

# EXERCISE 1

Create your first components

for the twitter clone

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# PROPS

Passing data between components 

from **parent to child**

---

# CODE EXAMPLE

Props

---

# EXERCISE 2

Pass props between components

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# COMPONENT LIFECYCLE

let's draw :)

---

# CODE EXAMPLE

**State**

Example code says more 

than a thousand words... ;)

---

# STATE & PROPS

- State is data **within** a component


- Props is data **between** components

---

# STATE SUMMARY

- One way data binding


- Events


- Re-render !== Repaint

---

# EXERCISE 3

Add state to a component:

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# FORMS

- Uncontrolled inputs: DOM


- Controlled inputs: state

---

# CODE EXAMPLE

Forms

- Uncontrolled inputs


- Controlled inputs

---

# EXERCISE 4

Add a component with a form

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3

---

# HURRAY!!!

<MyConfetti />

Our timeline functionality is DONE!

However, it’s all local state… :(

---

# APIS AND STATE

- You’ll need an HTTP library


- Keeping state in sync with api


- This is a side effect: useEffect hook

---

# CODE EXAMPLE

- API calls


- Sync state


- useEffect hook

---

# NITWIT API

https://nitwit-api.azurewebsites.net

---

# EXERCISE 5

Calling a REST API

https://bouwe.io/workshops/3
